Game Recommendation System
Overview
The Game Recommendation System suggests personalized game recommendations to users based on their preferences, gaming history, and user profile. It leverages machine learning algorithms and collaborative filtering techniques to predict and recommend games that users may enjoy.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Tailors game suggestions based on individual user preferences and past gaming history.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions (such as ratings or gameplay history) to make recommendations.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends games based on the attributes of games the user has previously enjoyed.
Rating Prediction: Predicts ratings for games that a user has not yet interacted with, enabling more accurate recommendations.
Multi-Platform Support: Recommends games available across various platforms (e.g., PC, PlayStation, Xbox, etc.).
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed before running the system:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package manager)
Setting Up the Project
1. Create a Virtual Environment
First, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

For Windows:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

For Windows:

bash
Copy
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt using pip. If the requirements.txt file doesn't exist, you can install individual packages as needed.

Install Streamlit:

bash
Copy
pip install streamlit
Other dependencies (if provided):

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application
Start the Streamlit app by running:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the app in your default web browser.
